# CURRENT STATUS OF THE GAME:
as part of the 100th commit, lets see where the game stands as of right now, February 20th:
* **Menus?** polished and spacious, still using black and white tho for combatibility.
* **Intro?** it's something... theres no tutorial or anything tho.
* **Battle System?** AMAZING! Perfect for all sorts of ememies, groups, and more. Now we just need some enemies and battles to have...
* **Inventory?** ALSO PRETTY COOL! System much more user friendly.
* **Player?** Solid and expandable if anything needs to be added. Only problem is with older saves, but that's not a big issue now.
* **Enemies?** Very lacking. Only Evil Turtles and Goblins, and some bosses
* **Shop?** Can be used in a variety of ways, even giving out new quests and such. Only 3 right now
* **Worlds?** Only 2 real worlds, and one is unfinished. System is however in place and functional to add more.
* **_CONTENT_**
  - **Early game?** Bad. There are only like 2 missions you can do, and one is hidden away in a town.
  - **Sustainability?** Nonexistant. There's no meat to this game yet -- no quests or ability to grow
  - **Late game?** There are bosses and such but with no mid game it doesn't really matter.

__OVERALL:__ Stable skeleton of a game ready to be fleshed out.
