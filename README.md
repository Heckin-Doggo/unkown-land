# CURRENT STATUS OF THE GAME:
as part of the 100th commit, lets see where the game stands as of right now, ~~February 20th:~~ UPDATED APRIL 11
* **Menus?** polished and spacious, still using black and white tho for combatibility.
* **Intro?** it's ok. could explain things better, but it demonstrates how battles work
* **Battle System?** AMAZING! Perfect for all sorts of ememies, groups, and more. Now we just need some enemies and battles to have... Plus, team attacks seem like a fun idea, but not implemented yet
* **Inventory?** ALSO PRETTY COOL! System much more user friendly.
* **Player?** Solid and expandable if anything needs to be added. Only problem is with older saves, but ~~that's not a big issue now.~~ they're just gonna have to deal with it. I'll only add compatability after 1.0 releases
* **Enemies?** Getting somewhere. Theres like maybe 10 battles you can do right now. It's something
* **Shop?** Can be used in a variety of ways, even giving out new quests and such. Only a few right now, nothing special
* **Worlds?** Only 3 real worlds, and still WIPs. System is however in place and functional to add more.
* **_CONTENT_**
  - **Early game?** Ok. Could have things sustained a bit more
  - **Sustainability?** Barely. There are some options in the way of quests.
  - **Late game?** Removed. It was pretty terrible, its getting reworked.

__OVERALL:__ Stable ~~skeleton~~ base of a game ready to be fleshed out.

## other stuff
shoutout to @RonMilman for teaching me about the wonderful pickle module. without his advice, saving would be such a pain in the ass and things would be very error prone
